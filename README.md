# 🐶 Dog vs Cat Image Classification 🐱

Welcome to the **Dog vs Cat Prediction** project! In this project, we developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of dogs and cats. The goal is to train a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting whether an image contains a dog or a cat. 🐕🐈

## 📖 Project Overview

In this project, we:

1. Preprocessed the images by **cleaning**, **resizing**, and **normalizing** them.
2. Built and trained a **CNN model** to perform image classification.
3. Evaluated the model using key metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and the **confusion matrix**.
4. Tested the model on new images and made predictions for **cat** or **dog**.

## 🎯 Aim

The aim of this project is to:
- Develop a CNN that can classify images into two categories: **cat** and **dog**.
- Achieve high **accuracy** and minimize misclassification between the two categories.
- Explore the model's performance using **evaluation metrics** like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.

## 📊 Key Results

- **Model Accuracy**: 85.02% on the test dataset 🎯
- **Confusion Matrix Insights**:
  - True Positives (Dog correctly classified as Dog): 2049
  - True Negatives (Cat correctly classified as Cat): 2202
  - False Positives (Dog misclassified as Cat): 418
  - False Negatives (Cat misclassified as Dog): 331

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Effectiveness of CNNs**: CNNs are powerful for image classification tasks, successfully learning key patterns and features from the images.
- **Misclassification Analysis**: Although the model achieved a high accuracy, some misclassifications still occurred, likely due to similarities in image features.
  
## 🚀 Future Improvements

- **Data Augmentation**: Increasing the variability in training data to improve generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different architectures, learning rates, and regularization techniques to enhance performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Using pre-trained models such as **VGG16** or **ResNet** to boost the model’s accuracy and robustness.

### 📝 Conclusion

In this project, we developed a CNN to classify images of cats and dogs, achieving a solid accuracy score. While the model works well, there is room for improvement, and future enhancements like **data augmentation**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **transfer learning** can help improve performance.
